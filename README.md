# C-Calculator

The first project on my journey of learning the basics of C.
Just a simple console based calculator.

### How does it work?

Upon execution the program will ask you for any of the following operations:

  "+", "-", "*", "/"
a
After you have provided your operation of choice it will promp you to input the numbers you want to perform it on.
For division specifically there is an error message for divide by zero.
Finally it wil output the result.
